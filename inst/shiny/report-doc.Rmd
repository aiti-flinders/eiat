## Disclaimer

The EIAT is an online input-output (I-O) analysis tool for Local Goverment Areas across Australia, developed by the Australian Industrial Transformation Institute at Flinders University, in conjunction with AURIN. This tool is designed to enable users to conduct regional economic impact analyses.

Input-Output models provide a standard approach for the estimation of the economic impact of a particular activity (e.g. construction of a new infrastructure project). A regional economic impact statement regarding the impact of major projects and policies has become a critical part of regional development analysis, and is an extensive component of the applied economic literature. The linkages between employment opportunities and residents - and business to business linkages affect urban design and transport systems, infrastructure demand, and regional taxes, amongst others.

This report was generated with EIAT Version: `r eiat:::eiat_version()` on `r Sys.Date()`.

## Data Supplied

The direct capital expenditure change estimated to occur in `r params$region` is shown in Table \@ref(tab:input).

## Employment Impacts

This project is estimated to generate `r scales::comma_format(0.1)(sum(data[["emp"]][data[["emp"]]$type %in% c("Direct Employment", "Flow on Employment"), ]$value))` full time equivalent jobs (FTE) over `r max(as.numeric(data[["emp"]]$year)) - min(as.numeric(data[["emp"]]$year)) + 1` year(s). `r  scales::comma_format(0.1)(sum(data[["emp"]][data[["emp"]]$type == "Direct Employment",]$value))` of these jobs are generated as a result of the direct capital expenditure, and the remaining `r  scales::comma_format(0.1)(sum(data[["emp"]][data[["emp"]]$type == "Flow on Employment",]$value))` jobs are generated through this expenditure flowing through to other sectors of the economy.
