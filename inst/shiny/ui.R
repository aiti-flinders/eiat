                      Input-Output models provide a standard approach for the estimation of the economic impact of a particular activity
                      (e.g. construction of a new infrastructure project). A regional economic impact statement regarding the impact of
                      major projects and policies has become a critical part of regional development analysis, and is an extensive component
                      of the applied economic literature. The linkages between employment opportunities and residents - and business to business linkages affect
