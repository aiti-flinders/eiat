</h2>
<p>The Economic Impact Assessment Tool (EIAT) allows users to estimate
the impact of an investment activity in a region (Local Government Area)
in terms of Gross Regional Product (GRP) and full time equivalent (FTE)
employment<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;Note that 1 FTE does not necessarily mean 1 person
employed. For example, 2 people who combined work full-time hours
(defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as 35 hours) would
equate to 1 FTE.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Underpinning the EIAT are Input-Output tables for Australia and
individual LGAs. Input-Output tables represent how expenditure flows
between industries in terms of purchases and sales. They also contain
the primary inputs into production such as wages and salaries (the
labour input) and other value added. Input-Output tables quantify the
structure of an economy. The Australian Bureau of Statistics generates
an Input-Output table each year, which describes the Australian economy
in terms of 115 industry groups.</p>
<p>Input-Output modelling uses Input-Output tables to quantify the
impact of expenditure in one industry based on how that industry makes
purchases. For example, in order to build a new road, (a <em>direct</em>
expenditure) a construction company must purchase goods and services
from other construction companies, as well as businesses in other
sectors of the economy, which may include chemicals, machinery and
equipment, electricity, as well as direct labour. In turn, the
businesses who sell their goods and services to the construction company
also make their own purchases. A machinery and equipment hire business
makes purchases from other industries, and utilises direct labour from
their own employees. Employees also spend their labour income on
consumable goods such as food and drink, or workwear. These additional
purchases (<em>indirect</em> expenditures) can be added to the direct
effect of the construction project to create an estimate of its total
impact.</p>
<p>The flow from a direct expenditure does not continue without limit
because input-output tables are leaky. Expenditures which occur outside
the economy (ie, those expenditures which are imported) do not
contribute.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="important-assumptions">Important Assumptions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#important-assumptions"></a>
</h3>
<p>The use of an input-output model imposes a number of assumptions
which must be considered in interpreting the predicted impacts. The most
important of these assumptions are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Increases in demand in the region are serviced by industries with
constant proportions, and no significant price adjustments occur.</li>
<li>Industries have a linear production function, which implies constant
returns to scale, and fixed input proportions.</li>
<li>Firms within a sector are homogeneous, which implies they produce a
fixed set of products that are not produced by any other sector, and
that the input structure of all firms are the same.</li>
<li>The model is a static model that does not take into account the
dynamic processes involved in the adjustments to an external
change.</li>
</ol>
<p>While private and public stakeholders can use this tool to conduct
preliminary Input-Ouput analysis, it is recommended that expert
consultants are engaged for a full and detailed report on the
estimations of economic impacts, and the interpretations.</p>
</div>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="using-the-eiat">Using the EIAT<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-the-eiat"></a>
</h2>
<p>Before using the EIAT it is important that the user considers how the
investment being analysed interacts with the region in which it will
occur. The most important consideration is how much of the expenditure
will occur within the region. Any expenditure which occurs outside the
region can not be used to estimate either the economic impact in terms
of Gross Regional Product, or employment. The tool is not designed to
correct for this, and will not provide any warnings or errors if
expenditure outside the region is included in the input data. The
analyst should therefore have some local knowledge of the economic
structure of the region in order to estimate how much could potentially
be sourced from within the region.</p>
<p>When this data has been collected, the EIAT can be accessed <a href="https://aiti.shinyapps.io/eiat-app/" class="external-link">here</a>. The landing page
provides a description of the tool, a summary of the data used, and the
current version of the Regional Input-Output tables. It also reiterates
the assumptions present in Input-Output modelling, and the information
required to use the tool correctly.</p>

<h3 id="setting-project-parameters">Setting project parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-project-parameters"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="project-parameters.png"></p>
<p>The project parameters can be adjusted by selecting <strong>Project
Setup</strong> from the navigation bar at the top of the page. First
select the State, and then the Local Government Area of interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="entering-data">Entering data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#entering-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are two options to enter data into the tool. For relatively
simple analyses the user can first select the number of years into the
future over which the investment will continue. It is by default set to
1, and the first year is the current year.</p>
<p><img src="entering-data.png"></p>
<p>Next, enter the direct capital expenditure for each industry sector
into the table. Remember that these expenditures must be in basic
(sometimes called producer) prices - that is, they should exclude
margins, taxes, and subsidies - and must only be for expenditure which
will occur (or is expected to occur) within the region.</p>
<p><img src="data-input.png"></p>
<p>If you have a more complex analysis or want to keep a record of the
estimated expenditures, a template can be downloaded, based on the
parameters set out above, which can be opened in Microsoft Excel,
OpenOffice, or Google Sheets. The file can be renamed, but only .csv
files will be accepted by the tool. Once the data has been entered into
the template, it can be uploaded using the ‘Uploaded Data’ button.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, something may go wrong. The EIAT expects the file that
uploaded file to look like the file previously downloaded. If the
uploaded file has too many years of data or does not have appropriate
column names, the tool will issue a warning but still upload the data.
If the EIAT cannot read the uploaded file, it will show an error and
reset the data.</p>

<p>Once the direct capital expenditure data have been entered, a summary
of the input data can be obtained by selecting the <strong>Input
Summary</strong> tab from the navigation panel. Summary tables display
the total direct capital expenditure in the region by year, and by
industry and year. These tables can be downloaded, copied to clipboard,
or printed, by clicking the relevant button.</p>
<p><img src="trable-buttons.png"></p>
<p>Summary graphs visualise the input data by year, and by industry and
year. These graphs can also be downloaded as .png, .jpeg, and .pdf using
the controls shown below the graph.</p>
<p><img src="download-graphs.png"></p>
<p>The estimated economic impacts in terms of employment, and GRP can be
seen by selecting the Economic Impacts tab from the navigation panel.
For both employment impacts, and GRP impacts, annual and total tables
and graphs can be viewed.</p>
<p>The annual impacts table shows the estimated Direct, Flow-on and
Total employment or GRP generated through the direct capital expenditure
entered into the tool. Each years data can be exported, or viewed as a
graph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple years can be selected in the annual impacts tables. These
tables will now show the Direct or Flow-on values, only the Totals
impact for each year of data entered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total impacts table shows the total estimated Direct, Flow-on,
and Total employment or GRP generated across the entire duration of the
investment - i.e. summed over all years.</p>

</h2>
<p>It has been proposed to upgrade an existing road in the South
Australian Local Government Area of the <strong>Adelaide Hills</strong>.
The road construction is estimated to cost about $10 million over two
years, with some design and surveying to occur in the first year, and
the bulk of the construction to occur in the second year.</p>
<p>The economic impact of this project on the Adelaide Hills region can
be estimated using the EIAT. To do so, the user must consider how to
allocate the $10 million dollars of expenditure - both across time and
across industries.</p>
<p>The user knows the local area well and knows that the road upgrade is
relatively simple - there are no tunnels or grade separation. They
estimate that about 20% of the total project cost would occur in the
design and surveying phase, all occurring in the first year. The user
also knows that the design would be carried out by a local firm, but the
surveying would be done by a firm from another part of South Australia.
An additional $1 million is estimated to support hiring on site offices
and facilities, again from a local firm.</p>
<p>The user also estimates that although construction will begin in
2023, the majority of the construction activity will occur in 2024. They
also choose to make an estimate of how much of the construction activity
can be sourced from within the Adelaide Hills LGA. Given the size of the
project, and local knowledge of the industry, the user makes a
conservative estimate that the construction company will need to import
about half of all the products and services they require for the
project.</p>
<p>As such, the user decides to allocate the direct capital expenditure
across three industry sectors.</p>

<p>The Economic Impacts tab shows the economic impact of the project. In
2023, the project will generate 7 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) employees
as a direct result of the expenditure. An additional 6 FTE will be
generated through the Flow-on effects of the expenditure through the
economy. Overall, 13 FTE are created in 2023, with the majority (7)
occurring in the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services sector.
In 2024, 19 FTE are created. In the app, these results can be found in

<h3 id="regional-input-output-tables">Regional Input Output Tables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#regional-input-output-tables"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Regional Input-Output Tables used in this tool are derived from
the 115 sector Input-Output table provided by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics. Due to the availability of data at the regional level, this
table is aggregated to a 19 ANZSIC sector Input-Output Table for
Australia. This table is the basis for the Regional Input-Output
Tables.</p>
<p>Broadly, Input-Output modelling is based on direct coefficients - how
sales and purchases by an industry relate to the total production of
that industry. These direct coefficients are calculated for the
Australian Input-Output Table. Location Quotients are used to determine
if an industry in a region can be considered as significant as the
industry is across Australia. Significant determines whether or not a
region is capable of supplying to local industries at the same
proportion as the country as a whole. If not, the region supplies
proportionally less to local industries. A region never supplies
proportionally more than the country as a whole. Regional employment is
used to determine whether or not an industry in a region can be
considered significant. The Location Quotient is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
LQ_{i,r} = \frac{E_{i,r}}{\sum_i E_{i,r}}/\frac{\sum_r
E_{i,r}}{\sum_{i,r} E_{i,r}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(E_{i,r}\)</span> is the FTE
employment in region <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and industry
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>An industry in a region is said to be significant if <span class="math inline">\(LQ_{i,r} \geq 1\)</span>.</p>
