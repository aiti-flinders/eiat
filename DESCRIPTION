Description: This package enables the creation of 19 Sector Input-Output Tables for Australian Local Government Areas 
            for use with the Economic Impact Assessment Tool (EIAT) developed by the Australian Industrial Transformation Institute for
            the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN). This package includes pre-calculated Regional Input-Output 
            tables for the 556 Local Government Areas defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as at 2021. The Regional 
            Input-Output Tables are derived from the Australian National Accounts: Input-Output Tables publication 
            (https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/national-accounts/australian-national-accounts-input-output-tables/latest-release).
